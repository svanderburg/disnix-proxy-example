		This is a trivial example case to demonstrate how upgrades can be made 
		completely atomic by means of a TCP proxy. The example system consists of
		a very simple server and client communicating through a TCP socket.
		By using an alternative composition the proxy is being used for communication
		between the server and client, which is notified
		by Disnix before the upgrade starts. The proxy then drains connections
		during the upgrade. In this phase, Disnix waits until
		there are no activate connections before it starts the actual upgrade.
		New connections made by a client during this
		phase are queued. If there are no activate connections the upgrade starts.
		After the upgrade the proxy is notified to accept connections again.
